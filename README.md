# Express Magic MVC
## What is it?
A simple and lightweight framework built on express with the goal of making it quick and simple to create controllers, but open enough to let you add what you need.

## Why?
I know, I know, yet another MVC framework for node and express. I tried not to reinvent the wheel, I really did, but as I played with the others out there, they ended up
on the two ends of the spectrum: either they didn't automate enough or they became so prescriptive I couldn't choose packages I wanted to use.

## How do I use it?
TBD
